    Compute hazard curves on a list of sites, given a set of seismic sources
    and a set of ground shaking intensity models (one per tectonic region type
    considered in the seismic sources). No assumtions are made on sources'
    temporal occurrence models.

    Probability of ground motion exceedance is computed using the following
    formula ::

        P(X≥x|T) = 1 - ∏ ∏ Prup_ij(X<x|T)

    where ``P(X≥x|T)`` is the probability that the ground motion parameter
    ``X`` is exceeding level ``x`` one or more times in a time span ``T``, and
    ``Prup_ij(X<x|T)`` is the probability that the j-th rupture of the i-th
    source is not producing any ground motion exceedance in time span ``T``.
    The first product ``∏`` is done over sources, while the second one is done
    over ruptures in a source.

    The above formula computes the probability of having at least one ground
    motion exceedance in a time span as 1 minus the probability that none of
    the ruptures in none of the sources is causing a ground motion exceedance
    in the same time span. The basic assumption is that seismic sources are
    independent, and ruptures in a seismic source are also independent.
